Created a personal portfolio website using Bootstrap utilizing a responsive layout.

A consistent navbar is utilized throughout the site with the name of the site located on the left and links to other pages justified to the right side.

index.html is made up of a card taking up 8 col in the grid. Inside the card is a responsive image of my face with a personal bio and social media link. This layout will respond to `xs` screens as elements will stack on top of each other.

portfolio.html is made up of a card within a container that takes up 100% of the width of said container. Inside the card are two rows with the 12 columns being cut in half between to col-6. In each row are two pictures separated into the two main columns. These are to represent the projects.

contact.html is also made up of a card taking up 8 col in the grid. Inside the card is a form that is responsive. Inside the form the user is asked to provide their name, email address, and a message.
